        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>In the year of 2000 I was born in central Florida. My date of birth is the 10th of october. I enjoy 
    playing video games and I really like cars. 
    I moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania when I was in 7th grade. The move from Florida to 
    Pennsylvania sucked for me.
    Although I made friends I also had a number of people I disliked. But maybe thats just 
    middle school life. I went from being an 
    outside kid to being on xbox all the time. Due to lack of freedom, friends, and also the 
    weather change I just changed as a person. Thankfully 
    I have continued to change to this day but I am still trying to find myself and who I am. 
    So I am gonna let you know what I know about me so far.
</p>
<h2>Cars</h2>
<p>I enjoy many cars. I enjoy watching the market evolve and apreciating the past. Although many of my favorite 
    cars are from before my time there are many new cars that appear in my dreams.
