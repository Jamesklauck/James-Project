        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        

        <h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>In the year of 2000 I was born in central Florida. My date of birth is the 10th of october. I enjoy 
    playing video games and I really like cars. 
    I moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania when I was in 7th grade. The move from Florida to 
    Pennsylvania was rough for me.
    Although I made friends I also had a number of people I disliked. But maybe thats just 
    middle school life. I went from being an 
    outside kid to being on xbox all the time. Due to lack of freedom, friends, and also the 
    weather change I just changed as a person. Thankfully 
    I have continued to change to this day but I am still trying to find myself and who I am. 

</p>
<h2>Cars</h2>
<p>I enjoy many cars. I enjoy watching the market evolve and apreciating the past. Although many of my favorite 
    cars are from before my time there are many new cars that appear in my dreams.
</p>

<h2>Video Games</h2>
<p>
    Although I feel like my love for video games is fading by the day, they are still my favorite way to 
    consume media. Being able to interact with an alternate world is really amazing in my eyes. I dont know 
    if I'm just growing up or if the video game industry is becoming stale. The only thing really keeping me 
    on the game is playing with my friends. So at this point it's more of a social thing. But still, it's one 
    of my dreams in life to have a really cool gaming setup/room.
</p>
<h3>Favorite Video Games</h3>
<ul class ="games">
    <li>Minecraft</li>
    <li>COD Black ops 2</li>
    <li>GTA 5(back in the xbox 360 days)</li>
    <li>For Honor</li>
    <li>Legend of Zelda BOTW</li>
</ul>
    
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>I love music just as much as the next person(maybe more). I just think it's the perfect 
        way to express yourself. Music can make you feel every emotion all with an album. I really like 
        listening to albums entirely because when I can keep listening to this piece and find a new 
        favorite 
        song every listen especially when it's a really good album and to keep falling in love with 
        different 
        lyrics in the same song or album is really amazing. Nothing can touch you like music can.
    </p>
    <h2>Pets</h2>
    <p>I'm extremely fascinated by animals, but I don't want alot of resposibility. In the future I only want a dog and a cat and 
        maybe a fish tank. But I don't have the space for that right now but I do have a fish. His name is 
        Inosuke and he is named after an anime character. He's a double tail Beta and although he doesn't provide 
        what other pets provide, I still really enjoy the presence of another being in my room.
